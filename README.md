# Web Apps

## [Hurts Where?](https://hurtswhere.com/)

I made this web app for workers' compensation attorneys to make collecting information on client pain easier during COVID times. I'm especially proud of the PDF reports that get generated and sent to the attorney to be attached to the client's file.

**Built with:** React, Firebase Cloud Functions, and Mailgun

## [Wells Bell](https://wellsbell.com/)

Another web app inspired by the pandemic, I originally created this simple bell to help my middle school students who were having trouble getting to virtual classes on time. The most satisfying thing about this project was seeing students, and even some teachers, use it at school.

**Built with:** React

## [Progress](https://progress-rosy.vercel.app/)

This app is a recreation of Neal Agarwal's [Progress](https://neal.fun/progress/). It was just a quick project, but doing some calendar arithmetic was a fun problem to solve.

**Built with:** React

## [Token Text](https://github.com/swalschuler/condition-ref?tab=readme-ov-file#token-text)

An [Owlbear Rodeo](https://www.owlbear.rodeo/) extension for showing user defined text when specific tokens are added to a virtual table top. Creating this extension required getting familiar with the Owlbear Rodeo API.

**Built with:** React and Zustand

# Desmos Activities and Experiments

While working as an interaction developer, I've spent some time creating small games and interactions to sharpen my skills. Here are a few of my favorites.

## [Taking Flight!](https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/638588ef20c1c10162570805?collections=641c7b5b8b3c2ee5ae5b6ac5)

An activity that I put together as part of a newsletter introducing a new tool to users.

## [The Game of Sim](https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/643dcb73a2f315b81ce4b197?collections=641c7b5b8b3c2ee5ae5b6ac5)

This game was shared with users as part of an annual community building event. One neat detail is that all of the game's logic is built inside the graphing calculator.

# Presentations

## Mathematical World Building - 2021

This is a PD session I presented to fellow math teachers in Dublin. It was so fun to dissect digital feedback with great teachers and then introduce them to the Desmos Computation Layer.

Here is the session blurb:

> Feedback is essential to the learning process, but what can that feedback look like in a digital activity? In this session, we will explore how to create activities which attach meaning to student thinking and allow them to interact with the mathematical worlds we are building in our classes. We'll cover the basics of interpretative feedback and create a few interactions using the Desmos Computation Layer. This session is based on Dan Meyer's blog post "[Computer Feedback That Helps Kids Learn About Math and About Themselves.](https://blog.mrmeyer.com/2020/computer-feedback-that-helps-kids-learn-about-math-and-about-themselves/)"

## WICOR Strategies - 2022

As part of my school's AVID Site Team, I presented a session on what WICOR strategies are and how to WICORize a lesson.

One of the key takeaways of this session was that great teaching strategies are those that center students as active learners.

## Intro to Computation Layer (CL) - 2023 and 2024

For this session, I worked with a colleague to co-present for new [Desmos Classroom Fellows](https://amplify.com/desmos-classroom-fellows). We worked through the basics of CL, and participants left with a set of challenges to work through on their way to CL mastery.
